A Recipe Card Generator

This is a web-based recipe card generator. It allows users to input a recipe's title, ingredients, and instructions, and an image to create and display a dynamic, visually appealing recipe card. The cards can be added and deleted, with all recipes saved for future visits. (someday maybe, i don't think we're there yet but hopefully yeah)
